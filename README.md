# Floating-Body-With-Adjustable-Buoyancy
An experimental project to demonstrate the stability of floating bodies and adjustable buoyancy levels, designed using a PVC pipe and a water pump system for practical applications in marine and defense industries

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the stability of floating bodies and adjustable buoyancy using a simple yet effective experimental setup. Designed for applications in the **marine industry** (ships, boats) and **defense industry** (torpedoes, mines), it integrates the concepts of **metacentric height** and **buoyancy** to ensure stability at different submersion levels.

## Motivation
- Marine engineering: Stability design for ships and boats.
- Defense applications: Understanding buoyancy and stability for torpedoes and underwater mines.

---

## Project Goals
1. Understand the **metacentre** and **metacentric height** using theoretical concepts and practical experiments.
2. Design a floating body capable of:
   - Floating with a specified fraction of its volume submerged.
   - Adjusting the fraction dynamically during the experiment using a pump-controlled water system.

## Experimental Design
- **Materials Used**:
  - **PVC Pipe**: Main body structure.
  - **Acrylic Sheets**: Sealed ends for waterproofing.
  - **Water Pump System**: For controlled inlet and outlet of water, enabling dynamic buoyancy adjustments.
  - **Additional Components**: Valves, tubing, and mounting frame.
